👋 Hey, I’m @Pratham-Gauswami — a recent computer science graduate with a strong interest in using software to tackle real-world challenges.

💡 I'm especially drawn to building solutions that make a tangible impact. Whether it’s simplifying everyday tasks or addressing larger systemic issues, I believe software has the power to change how we live and work — and I’m excited to be part of that journey.

🛠️ I’ve been sharpening my skills in software engineering, from clean coding practices to modern development tools and frameworks. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, exploring creative solutions, and staying up to date with how tech is evolving.

🤝 I’m actively looking to connect with others who are starting something exciting — whether it’s a side project, a startup idea, or an open-source initiative. If you’re someone who loves building cool things and learning along the way, I’d love to collaborate.

📫 Feel free to reach out via GitHub or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratham-goswami-331aa7240). Let’s create something meaningful together.
